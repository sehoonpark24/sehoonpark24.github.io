abstract: To what extent do women and men behave differently in political participation? Although the extant literature finds a traditional gender gap in political participation, with males displaying a higher likelihood of involvement than their female counterparts, an increasing number of recent political movements regarding gender equality raise a possibility of more active political participation among female voters. This study explores whether and why females actively participate in political activities such as petitions and protests in South Korea where feminism and its backlash have been strongly debated recently. Using an online survey, we find that women are more likely to participate in signing petitions than men. Regarding street protest participation, there is no systemic difference between men and women. Also, the active participation of females in petitions is stronger among younger generations and those with higher levels of gender sensitivity.

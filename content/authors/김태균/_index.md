I am an assistant professor at School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences and a joint professor at Graduate School of Data Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Science of Science and Innovation at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University.

My research revolves around the application of computational and statistical methods, complemented by experimental approaches, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of digital politics, political communication, and the interplay between science, policy, and politics.

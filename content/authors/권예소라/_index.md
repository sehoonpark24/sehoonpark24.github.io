I am Associate Professor of Political Science at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). Prior to joining SKKU, I was an assistant professor at Utah State University. My research in comparative politics and political economy examines the political causes and consequences of social and economic inequality in post-industrial democracies, with a particular emphasis on East Asia. I explore how the transformations associated with post-industrialization generate new social conflicts and divides, and how these emerging dynamics influence political behavior and reshape public policy. 

My recent projects explore the politics surrounding three key socio-economic transformations in advanced democracies: 1) population aging and low fertility, 2) gender divisions, and 3) technological advancement. In this context, I analyze political attitudes and electoral choices across different social groups and examine the policy responses of political elites.

I am an Associate Professor at the Division of Global Korean Studies at Korea University. I graduated from the Department of Politics at New York University in January 2016. Before my Ph.D. at NYU, I studied political science (MA) and English literature (BA) at Korea University.

My research interests are politics in Korea, mostly covering democracies, political development, authoritarian legacies, and political behaviors in Korea.
